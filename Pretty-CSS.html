    <p>
      O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term,
      write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no
      scribe refuse to write as Allāh has taught him. So let him write and let
      the one who has the obligation [i.e., the debtor] dictate. And let him
      fear Allāh, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who
      has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to
      dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to
      witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men
      [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as
      witnesses - so that if one of them [i.e., the women] errs, then the other
      can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called
      upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large,
      for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of Allāh and
      stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except
      when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves.
      For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take
      witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any
      witness. For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in you. And
      fear Allāh. And Allāh teaches you. And Allāh is Knowing of all things.
